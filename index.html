            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>ThinkPads are business-grade laptops with a focus on durability and upgradability, even though some recent models have components like RAM soldered onto the motherboard</p>
			<p>They are known for excellent keyboards, long battery life, and excellent build quality.</p>
			<p>Due to their business focus, they typically perform better than regular consumer and even prosumer laptops in the same price ranges<p>

			<h2>Naming Scheme</h2>
			<p>Format: letter number number number letter</p>
			<p><strong>T</strong>: Thin 14-15" Medium sized laptop</p>
			<p><strong>X</strong>: More portable T series, with 12-13" screens, with the loss of some upgradability</p>
			<p><strong>W</strong>: Portable workstations; these have increased thickness for gains in CPU and GPU. These ususally have more room for upgradability</p>
			<p><strong>P</strong>: Current workstation line. Main difference is that they are thinner</p>
			<p><strong>X1</strong>: Modern flagships, thin and relatively powerful, around the MacBook Air</p>
			<p><strong>X1 Extreme</strong>: Much more powerful, similar to the MacBook Pro. They have much better performance and have a great balance of power, weight and durability, however a slight loss of battery life is the tradeoff</p>
			<br>
			<p>First number: Screen size eg. 4 -> 14", 6 -> 16"</p>
			<p>Second number: Generation</p>
			<p>Third number: Generation Revision</p>
			<p>Second Letter: Extras eg. y -> Yoga, p -> Power</p>
